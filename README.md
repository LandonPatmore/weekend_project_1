## Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

## What it does

The user can search any F1 season between 1950 and now and see the driver's standings as well as the constructor standings.

Made this for ease of use for historical records as well as current records because the F1 site changes a lot and can be hard to find the standings, especially historical records.
